# Graph-Layout
This project is on graph theory and basic Fraud Detection using graphs/ Networks.
It focuses of the layout of the graph this Application reads in an graph input from 
a text file and then creates an output graph were  with less edge crossings,  a Method
called Barycenter is used to accomplish this task(minimum edge crossings) so as to
make the graph more understandable.
